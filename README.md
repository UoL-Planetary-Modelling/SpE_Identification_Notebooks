Tasha Aylett (n.m.aylett@leeds.ac.uk), John Plane (J.M.C.Plane@leeds.ac.uk), Dan Marsh (D.Marsh@leeds.ac.uk), Wuhu Feng (w.feng@ncas.ac.uk), David Themens (d.r.themens@bham.ac.uk)

- A public repository is available for the draft paper at [https://github.com/tashaay/SpE_Identification_Notebooks.git ](https://github.com/tashaay/SpE_Identification_Notebooks). This contains the SpE identification algorithm, COSMIC data processing and analysis notebooks for figure plotting.

- Data for the project are found on the research data storage drive /resstore/b0243/Data/Sporadic_E/ which is mounted on arc4. Please contact Dan for Access.
 
- If you would like access to any additional resources (i.e my personal notebooks from Wavechasm/arc4), please contact me (Tasha). I have some more notebooks for processing the solar min/max runs, and for setting up the climate runs.
